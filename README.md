# Authorship-Analysis
Fall 2015

This program was written for my Programming Pragmatics class at MSU Denver. It reads in different text files by different authors assumed to be pieces of literature and analyzes them for certain traits. The program can then analyze a piece of literature with an unknown author and attempt to match that piece of literature with an author in it's database. The program uses serialization to store the gathered statistics so they can be used later and is prototyped through JFrame in Java.
